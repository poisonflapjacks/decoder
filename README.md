# Decoder Project

# Summary:
For this project the goal is to create a encoder/decoder in python. Users should be able to input a string of their choice. The deliverables should be an output to the console of the original message. The big take away is that during the inbetween steps, the code stores the original message in an encoded text file. The encoding will separate each word on it's own line and scramble the order so that if the text file was viewed before encoding, the input message would be indecipherable.
